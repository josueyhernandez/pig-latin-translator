# Kenzie Academy Challenge: Pig Latin

Follow the instructions provided on `my.kenzie.academy` for this challenge. The `code.js` file is a placeholder. Feel free to rename it or add additional files to the project.

Customize this README.md however you want to turn it into documentation for your project (including deleting these opening paragraphs). The only required section is **Reflection**, but if you used a unit testing framework, also fill in the **Running the Unit Tests** section. Be sure to use proper Markdown syntax in this file (here's a [cheatsheet PDF](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf) of the basic syntax).

## Running the Unit Tests

_(Instructions for how to install the unit testing framework and run the unit tests.)_

## Reflection

For a software developer, what are the benefits of good unit tests? Are there any drawbacks to writing unit tests?

The benefits of writing a good unit tests are that the developer can catch bugs easier and know what the problem with the code. It also can save you a lot of time, if you have over a hundred code and there's a bug without unit test you have to find the error while the uit test can tell you exactly where it is. Some draw backs is that whe it comes to console.assert it is time consuming especially if you have multiple functions.
